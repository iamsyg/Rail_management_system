      complaint: "The seat was completely broken and couldn't recline properly, making the entire journey extremely uncomfortable. The metal frame was protruding and caused damage to my clothing. Additionally, the armrest was loose and kept falling down throughout the trip. I reported this to the train staff, but they were unable to provide a replacement seat or any assistance. This was particularly frustrating as I had booked my ticket well in advance and expected a comfortable journey. I had to endure the discomfort for the entire 16-hour journey, which was unacceptable. I would like a full refund for this ticket as I couldn't use the seat properly. I also suggest that the train staff be trained to handle such complaints more effectively in the future. this is thr best thing that can be done to improve the experience of passengers.
